An IT professional who enjoys working on web (web2 or web3) and mobile security research, stay up to date on cybersec news, or reading a book (which can be either work related or fiction).

## What I'm working on.. 
I'm currently going through Try Hack Me and Hack The Box courses, as I find these give good value for money. 
After achieving a foundation, I want to get more comfortable with Burp Suite.
I also intend to complete network & infrastructure related courses. 
Apart from just wanting to know how things work, the knowledge can only compliment other topics.
