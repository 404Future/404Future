An IT professional who made the shift to cybersecurity about 2 years ago and enjoys working on cybersecurity research, stay up to date on cybersec news, or reading a book (which can be either work related or fiction).

## What I'm working on.. 
I'm currently going through the Hack The Box Web Penetration Tester course. 
After completing this course, I want to get more comfortable with Burp Suite.
As I do, I make notes of the courses I go through and keep them here on my GitHub. 

*Feel free to check my repositories if you're interested in what I'm working on.*
