I’m **404Future**, a **SOC Analyst** and **Offensive Security Researcher** focused on **web application security, emerging web3 platforms, and AI-driven systems**. My journey blends hands-on defensive experience with structured offensive learning, tooling development, and practical vulnerability research.

## 🧭 Philosophy

> **Manifesto:**  
> I prioritize **learning, execution, and methodology over certifications**. My work is guided by:
>
> - **Structured testing** - documenting methodologies, playbooks, and findings for repeatable, thoughtful results  
> - **Practical relevance** - applying real-world insights from SOC and IR to offensive security  
> - **Emerging tech focus** - web2, web3, and AI-driven systems are my growth areas  
> - **Consistency over hype** - progress is measured by skill, clarity, and impact, not titles or timelines
>
> *“Building skill, integrity, and opportunity across emerging attack surfaces.”*
