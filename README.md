An IT professional who enjoys working on web (web2 or web3) and mobile security research, stay up to date on cybersec news, or reading a book (which can be either work related or fiction).

## What I'm working on.. 
I'm currently going through Try Hack Me and Hack The Box courses, as I find these give good value for money. 
After achieving a foundation, I want to get more comfortable with Burp Suite.
I also intend to complete network & infrastructure related courses from the same vendors. 
I'm mostly eager to learn how things work, and believe that all knowledge gained can only compliment eachother.
