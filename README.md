## About Me

I’m **404Future**, a **SOC Analyst** and **Offensive Security-focused Web Security Researcher**.  
After transitioning into cybersecurity over **2 years ago**, I’ve gained hands-on experience in monitoring, detection, and incident response, while continuing to develop offensive expertise in my personal time.

Outside of SOC work, I focus on **web application penetration testing**, vulnerability research, and building tools to better understand modern exploitation techniques.
